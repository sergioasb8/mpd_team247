p1 = f"""
Welcome to the report, this last section summarizes all the significant findings 
during the development of the project, exposes its limitations, the requirements 
to improve it, in which other fields of action something similar can be executed 
and most importantly, answers the second hypothesis of the problem: What is the 
perception of the citizens in relation to the programs and projects during
the government's term? Enjoy the end of this journey!

"""

p2 = f"""
Thanks to the model it is now possible to tag each of our tweets with a sentiment 
and an associated prediction probability. At this point, it is time to put our approach 
under a critical eye and define lines of improvement or recognize its strengths.
To do this, the first thing we will do is to know the content of the tweets this 
time using more filters (time stamp, keyword and sentiment), with this it is easier 
to locate a positive or a negative tweet and see if it responds to a trend thanks to 
the variables of time or how much if they differ in the way of writing them, before 
moving to the conclusions of this section we invite you to generate a couple of random 
tweets and generate ideas and see how much they match the ideas proposed by those 
responsible for the project. 

"""

p3_1 = f"""

After several minutes of exploration (it is very catching), we can affirm that 
the context of the word and its wide semantic spectrum deviates the ability to 
conclude with total certainty the reflection of a need. An example of this, 
could be the keyword 'Trabajo', our goal at the time it was chosen was to be used 
as a proxy for the macroeconomic variable of employment, however, many job offer 
tweets seem to surface and according to the model algorithm they will be classified 
in some sentiment, but is then a job offer something positive? We could state what 
yes, new jobs are generated and employment is expected to be reduced, but what about 
'Trabajo' when it refers to someone's job? Here the interpretation is more subjective.
"""
p3_2 = f"""

With this, for the future development of the project we have proposed to add the 
sentiment 'neutral' to the classification categories so that texts that are not 
very clear to define do not bias our interpretation (cell phone plan spam, we 
refer to you). The other recommendation is to generate subcategories when querying 
the API or when exploring the chosen category, using NLP and extending the previous 
example, we could use a subcategory that refers to job offers and interpret it as an 
indicator for the generation of new positions, while giving a wider range to the 
user if they wants to know more specific dynamics.
"""
p3_3 = f"""

One approach proposed for the development of this project was to use the programs and 
projects of each of the strategic lines, however, this made it impossible for us to compare 
them before and after because we would have no way to explore them before the plan, since 
they had not been executed until the current mayor took office. This is a reminder that the 
initial problem must always be kept in mind and that the approach must be coherent. Remember to share your findings with us.

"""

p4 = f"""
To answer the second question proposed in the problem we needed information that would 
allow us to visualize a change in the number of positive and negative tweets over 
time and how was the behavior on twitter for these same keywords before the development 
plan of the city of Medellin came into force. Therefore, we decided to visualize the 
proportion of positive tweets compared to negative ones, and thus have the change month 
by month in the years of our analysis. We invite the user to explore the graph before 
jumping to the conclusions, and to complement the information in this with the previous 
section, if you see a very pronounced change in any of the months, use the random tweet 
generator for that date and know the nature of them.

"""

p5 = f"""
The first finding to highlight is the appearance of two clusters in all years, one set 
of words has a higher proportion of negative tweets while others stand out for the positive, 
to go deeper into this we will have to look at the proportion in detail. The second, 
best seen in the report document associated with this project, where more clearly this 
will be detailed (spoiler alert), trends or seasonality reflect volatility. 

"""

p6 = f"""
When we were discussing the conclusions of the project, one of our members wondered 
what made a keyword to be recognized as negative or positive, going into detail about 
this could give us an approximation to the content they express and their social load. 
What usually accompanies this keyword? With how much recurrence? Is this easy to interpret? 
Is there a very marked difference between positive and negative sentiment according to the 
filtered word? For this we generated word clouds where we grouped the frequency of words 
from tweets categorized by positive, negative and general (or words in common), remember 
to draw your conclusions before moving on to ours.
"""

p7 = f"""
This analysis was more profitable than expected, it could even serve as an input to 
generate new public policies in order to change the citizen's perception of sensitive 
issues, the power of social networks cannot be underestimated. The most evident example 
of this section was with the keyword "culture", in common terms culture is centered on being 
"paisa", on its people, on the city, they seem to be very proud of them, also of their "metro", 
however, the more they love it, the more they seem to criticize it. For the positive, we find 
the expected, words like art, theater, music, artists, festivals take importance, but when we 
focus on the opposite side, another reality appears. The negative culture of Medellin is associated 
with violence, Pablo Escobar, mafias, a "traqueta" culture and cartels, this exploration by opposite 
poles allows us to evidence the good performances of some subcategories of the key word, while 
sounding the alarm for those associated with negative feelings. 


"""

p8 = f"""
To close we wanted to list those keywords that after our analysis represented a high unfavorable 
image, and highlight those with better performance in terms of interaction on Twitter. Therefore, 
we focused on sentiment proportionality in each of our categories. Do you have any idea which 
keywords might be the ones with the highest negative interaction?

"""

p9 = f"""
The words with the highest number of negative tweets are: 'Metro', 'Movilidad' and 'Seguridad', 
while the words with the highest number of positive tweets are: 'Vida', 'Trabajo' and 'Cultura'. We can 
also highlight the word that generates the least interaction: 'Tecnologia' and the two with the 
most interaction: 'Metro' and 'Vida'. We hope this tour has been to your liking, remember to 
consult all the complementary resources to this project to go into technical details and 
complement the sections.
